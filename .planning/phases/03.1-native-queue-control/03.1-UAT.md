## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. No Impact Pack Required
expected: Batch iteration works without Impact Pack custom nodes installed. Verify Impact Pack is NOT in your custom_nodes folder, then run a batch.
result: pass

### 2. Batch Stops After Last Image
expected: After processing the last image in the directory, queue execution stops automatically. No infinite loop, no manual intervention needed.
result: pass

### 3. Multiple Batches Work Consecutively
expected: Run a batch to completion. Then run another batch (same or different directory). Both complete correctly without restart.
result: pass
